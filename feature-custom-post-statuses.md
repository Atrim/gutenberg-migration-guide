# Custom Post Statuses

Covers the unofficial custom post statuses feature of the Classic Editor.

## Overview

WordPress has an incomplete and unofficial API for registering custom post statuses.

In the past, plugins and themes have used this API, in conjunction with custom code, to expose a more complex publishing workflow in the Classic Editor.

## Gutenberg Equivalent

Gutenberg doesn't formally support the custom post statuses API, and no representation of custom post statuses appear in its UI.
